# GitHub User Languages
A little Chrome Extension that draws a pie chart on GitHub User profiles detailing their language breakdown. Built with TypeScript, Chart.js and :heart:.

Recently, I have wanted a little graph that shows the language breakdown of a user right on their profile.

So I decided to make just that!

## Install
Installation is coming soon for Chrome.

Firefox version is planned but currently not even started, although I doubt there'll be much to change.

## Roadmap

- [x] Draw the pie chart
- [ ] Design an extension icon
- [ ] Make it available on the chrome store
- [ ] Add storage of data for users to avoid over-using the Github API and getting rate limited
- [ ] Create a version for Firefox browsers

Contributing doesn't just mean writing code!

If you think of anything that could benefit the project, open up an [issue](https://github.com/crnbrdrck/github-user-langs/issues).

I'm also not that great at writing READMEs so help with this one would be very welcome!
